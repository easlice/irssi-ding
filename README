This script will play a sound whenever you receive a message. It does this via
aplay or mpg123, depending on the file extension, and you can load up sounds
for several kinds of messages. By default it only plays messages with level
PUBLIC or PRIVATE, all others are ignored. It also ignores any messages you
send yourself.

NOTE: If a sound is not set for a particular message type, no sound will be
played. No error will be given if the sound file can not be played for any
reason.
